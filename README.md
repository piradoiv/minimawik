MinimaWik
==============================

MinimaWik is a Wiki system with some cool features, like real-time editing, previewing and saving (the content is auto-saved 1.5 seconds after you stop writing).

The system has been written on top of [CodeIgniter](http://www.codeigniter.com/) Framework, usign [DataMapper ORM](http://datamapper.wanwizard.org/) for the Database queries.

For the frontend I'm using [Gumby](http://gumbyframework.com/) for the CSS Framework, the JavaScript's cool MarkDown editor is called [Ace](http://ace.ajax.org/).

There are lots of other technologies involved, so thank you very much to:

1. jQuery
2. GitHub
3. Sublime Text
4. [MediaVida](http://www.mediavida.com/) forums

Don't hesitate in contacting me for any questions you have, suggestions or just to say hello, I'm [@PiradoIV](http://twitter.com/PiradoIV) on Twitter.
